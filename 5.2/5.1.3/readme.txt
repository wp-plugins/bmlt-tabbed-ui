BMLT Tabbed UI implements a jQuery tabbed UI for BMLT.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a jQuery Tabbed UI and more for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).  Simply put the shortcode [bmlt_tabs] into a Wordpress page to get your very own tabbed interface to BMLT.  Not into a tabbed interface?  There is a shortcode parameter to display meetings without tabs.  This would be useful for Areas that have fewer meetings.  This plugin also provides various shortcodes to return the number of meetings and groups in specified service bodies.  Please visit settings - BMLT Tabbed UI for shortcode instructions.

== Installation ==

1. Place the 'bmlt-tabbed-ui' folder in your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate bmlt-tabbed-ui.
3. Enter BMLT Root Server into Settings - BMLT Tabs
4. Enter shortcode into a new or existing Wordpress page.
5. For shortcode usage see Settings - BMLT Tabs.
6. View your site.
7. Adjust the CSS of your theme as needed.
